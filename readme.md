## Demo screens

### Demo screen 1

In the screenshot below, a scenario with all module options enabled, to the left is the GMs screen, to the right is the Alban´s player screen.
Alban´s player can not see Orc Shaman(invisible) or Orc Archer 2(blocked line of sight), he can not see any other tokens/combatants active effects or the name of masked combatants. The token Eva has disposition of SECRET and therefore her initiative is hidden from Alban.
Alban has also been granted a second action(duplicated combatant).

### Demo screen 2

In this scenario, Alban´s player can only see other players that has a FRIENDLY disposition

#### Combatant

![](./resources/demo_screen_dropdown_combatant_control.jpg)

#### Phase Assignment

Each phase has a command control that can assign(move) a selection of combatants to it.

![](./resources/demo_screen_dropdown_phase_control.jpg)

##### Random from Unset

This will take a random combatant from the Unset phase. Combatants in a group that shares the initiative and option for Phase sharing enabled, will be handled as a single combatant and if selected by the random dice, all members of that group will be assigned to the same phase.

#### Effect summary tooltip

If a combatant has more active effects than can be displayed in the combat tracker, all effects will be replaced by a summary icon. This icon has a tooltip that displays all effects.

## Module Compatibility

Foundry version 10, 11

## Module Definitions

This module uses two definitions that can be confusing, **Round Set** and **Phases**. The actual label for these functionalities differs between RPG systems but for the module functionality these are the definitions used. Round Set and Phases can be enabled at the same time.

### Round Set

A Round Set is a set of Foundry rounds, meaning you can define phases, segments or whatever your system call them and have the combat tracker go from one round to another and start again with the first round.

Use the Round Set Editor found in the module´s Configure Game Settings or, when Round Set is enabled, the Encounter Control Dropdown, to define custom rounds.

![](./resources/roundset-editor-basic.jpg)

### Phases

A Phase is a part of a Foundry round. This feature divides the Foundry round into phases which each has its own initiative order. Combatants is assigned to a phase. You can use any naming for phases, it could be like in the example below  or just "Players", "Enemies", "Allies" etc.

A "Unset" phase is always added to the defined phases and will be the default phase a combatant is assigned to when added to an encounter. The name displayed for the Unset phase can be changed in settings.

Use the Phase Editor found in the module´s Configure Game Settings or, when Phases is enabled, the Encounter Control Dropdown, to define custom phases.

![Phase Editor](./resources/phase-editor-basic.jpg)

### Combatant Groups

Groups comes in two major flavors, groups that shares initiative and groups that does not share initiatives

#### Non-sharing groups

Indicated by a dashed left border.

Combatants in a non-sharing group are treated as any other combatant. The grouping is merely a logical extension to be used for helping the GM to keep gangs/bands/strike teams etc  together.

![](./resources/group_non_sharing.jpg)

#### Initiative sharing groups

Indicated by a solid left border

Combatants in a sharing group is handles as a single combatant, if initiative (or phase if option is checked) is changed for one combatant in the group, the others are updated to match.

## Module background

As some may know, I am the current developer of the system building Foundry System [Sandbox](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sandbox)

Sometime we make the occasional system with Sandbox that has some other way of handling initiatives so when I the other week went to look for a module to have different combat phases with reversed initiative order, I could not find anything that suited my needs. Being a Foundry programmer, I just thought to myself. "Hey, that cant be so hard to throw something together".  So, I started writing a module for it and of course, other ideas/functions crept in and turned that into a larger thing than originally intended. And thus, the "Combat Tracker Extensions" was born.

## Source code used

Combat Tracker Extension is built on a base from  [Reverse Initiative Order](https://github.com/sun-dragon-cult/fvtt-module-reverseinitiativeorder) by [Åke Wivänge](https://github.com/wake42)
